A weather application I built to practice my <br>
level of JavaScript and learning how to use OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data 

<br> 
1. This is the app upon starting<br>
(nothing fancy, just a search bar expecting a city name)

2. Enter a city of your choice<br>
3. (I chose Toronto, any city works as long as its spelled correctly)
